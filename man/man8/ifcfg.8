.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B ifcfg
command.
.PP
This is a simplistic script replacing one option of 
.B ifconfig
, namely, IP address management. It not only adds
addresses, but also carries out Duplicate Address Detection RFC-DHCP,
sends unsolicited ARP to update the caches of other hosts sharing
the interface, adds some control routes and restarts Router Discovery
when it is necessary.

I strongly recommend using it 
.RI instead
of
.RI ifconfig
both on hosts and on routers.
